Angular :
         Traditional Page Application: Requests all the required resources every time a new page is loaded.

         Single Page Application: Loads pages in wrappers and required files are loaded from cache once the main file is loaded
         from the server.

         Node js: Javascript library
         grunt/gulp: packages build on node


Architecture:
             MVW (Model View, W): Model(html), View(css), Controller(Js)
             Everything is a component(head, menu, etc) i.e. resusable html code
