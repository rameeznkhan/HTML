CSS
Three main types of css
  Inline
  Internal
  External

  Inline and Internal not amongst best practices

  CSS format attribute:value;
  e.g color: red;

  P {
  color: red;
  background: black;
  }

  In the above eg p tag is called a selector

  There are 5 types of selectors
  1 Element Selector: P is an element selector
  Data id class title can be used for any element

  2 Class and id selector:
  We use "." for class and "#" for ids.

  !important will give more priority to the property it is used with. Not recommended to use though.

  Id is unique cannot be used on multiple elements.

  3 Parent-Child selector:
  Used to apply style to elements using the relations.

  4. Grouping:
    Comma separated name of elements for applying similar styles

  5. Psuedo Classes:
      Special events such as hover etc.
      Applicable for only anchor tag:
      :link
      :visited
      :active
      Important Psuedo classes:
        Child classes:
           first-child
           last-child
           nth-child(2);
  Additional
